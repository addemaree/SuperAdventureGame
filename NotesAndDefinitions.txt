	Objectives:
		-What is a class constructor?
		-How to use a class constructor to set the properties of an object, during the object's instantiation
		-How a child (derived) class can call the constructor of its base class

	Class Constructor: Every class starts with a constructor that is public and named after the class. However, we 
		can make our own contructors that do more than this default action. So, a class constructor can be created to
		accept the values we want to store in the properties.
			-Constructor makes your code a little shorter/cleaner.
			-Also helps double-check that you have set all the properties
			-If you forget a parameter you will get an error

	Parameters:
		When you run a function, or method (like a constructor), it can accept values.
			-in C#, you need to declare the datatype of the parameter and its name.
			-when calling the constructor, and creating a new object, you MUST pass in the values within the parameter

	Objectives:
		-What a static class is, and how to create one
		-When you want, and don't want, to use static classes
	Static Class:
		-A static class is one that is always available to the rest of your program, like public classes, but with static
		you don't need to create an object from it. In fact, you can't create an object from it. It's just there
			- A static class is a place to hold shared resources (variables and methods), since there will only be the one
			INSTANCE of it, and everything else in your program will use that one, shared set of methods and variables
	Why would you need a static class?
		-It allows you to store things in your program that will be used several places in the program.
		-It is one way to make all your information available everywhere
	Problems with Static Classes:
		-Static methods and variables are unable to change, so when you decide to use a static variable to hold a value,
		make sure it's one that you really want to be shared for every user.
