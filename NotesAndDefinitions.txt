	Objectives:
		-What is a class constructor?
		-How to use a class constructor to set the properties of an object, during the object's instantiation
		-How a child (derived) class can call the constructor of its base class

	Class Constructor: Every class starts with a constructor that is public and named after the class. However, we 
		can make our own contructors that do more than this default action. So, a class constructor can be created to
		accept the values we want to store in the properties.
			-Constructor makes your code a little shorter/cleaner.
			-Also helps double-check that you have set all the properties
			-If you forget a parameter you will get an error

	Parameters:
		When you run a function, or method (like a constructor), it can accept values.
			-in C#, you need to declare the datatype of the parameter and its name.
			-when calling the constructor, and creating a new object, you MUST pass in the values within the parameter
